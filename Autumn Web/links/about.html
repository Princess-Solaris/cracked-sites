			<h4>Who we are</h4>
                <p>The Omaha Design Center was created by event planners for event planners.  Owners Nick and Brook Hudson also produce Omaha Fashion Week with their partners, Greg and Molly Cutchall.  After moving their event to venues all over the city (and building massive air conditioned tents on multiple empty parking lots around downtown) they decided to build a space that would be a beautiful blank slate, where they and other event organizers could leave their creative mark. </p>
                <p>The Omaha Design Center features polished concrete floors, white leather soft seating, 50-inch chandeliers, 2 miles of sheer fabric draping and color-changing LED-lighting. Whether you are looking for a turn-key, all inclusive venue that requires very little in the way of decor or you are looking to create a floor-to-ceiling, multi-sensory experience for your guests...the Omaha Design Center offers you the flexibility and convenience to make your event a memorable one.</p>

			<h4>A bit of history</h4>
                <p>If you have never experienced Macon in bloom, we highly recommend following the Cherry Blossom Trail, which guides visitors on a blossom-filled route throughout the city. The Trail begins at the Visitor’s Center in lovely downtown Maconcherrytrees - 3rd St Park 2011 (192) and includes Wesleyan Drive, home to the founder of the Festival, and where Carolyn Crayton envisioned thousands of trees being planted. You can follow the trail at your own pace, and you’ll enjoy glimpses of Macon’s many historic buildings. Macon contains 12 historic districts and over 6,500 structures that are designated on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
				<p>Cherry Trees will be sold at Lowe Lighting located at 1525 Forsyth Street starting March 16th from 9:00-5:00. They will also be there from the 19th to the 23rd from 9:00-5:00. Keep Macon-Bibb Beautiful will also be selling them at the Mulberry Arts and Craft Festival on March 24-25. For more detailed information on the cherry tree sells, call Pam Carswell, Presidents and CEO of the Keep Macon-Bibb Beautiful Commission.</p>
